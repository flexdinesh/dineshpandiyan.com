# INSTRUCTIONS

## PROJECT

This is a personal website built with hugo.

- markdown for content
- vanilla css `assets/css/*.css`
- esm js `assets/js/*.mjs` (although they are not used anywhere now)

## CODING SYLE

JavaScript guidelines:

- use ES modules and modern import syntax

Styling guidelines:

- use modern syntax
- prefer css variables for anything that will apply to more than one page
- for high level page layouts, use grid
- for inner sections, use flexbox
- avoid block/inline styles unless absolutely necessary
- avoid absolute/relative positioning unless absolutely necessary
- do not add inline styles to html elements
- prefer responsive styles with mobile first approach

HTML elements:

- use good a11y practices while structuring elements in the page

Hugo templates:

- use relative path wherever possible. use absolute paths only when necessary.
