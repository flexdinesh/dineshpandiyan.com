i want to migrate the current app to hugo. i have a backup of my current code in a different branch.

here are the high level goals:

- all my content is in content/ dir
- current stack: astro, tailwind, custom code for markdown to page
- new stack: hugo, markdown with goldmark, frontmatter to configure page data, hand rolled css with css variables for theme switching
- use latest version of all the tools in the new stack and refer to latest version of docs
- keep the code as simple as possible. stack longevity is the main goal. i shouldn't need to the upgrade the stack for 10 years.
- keep everything fully static. build should generate the entire website. all pages are fully static.
- only use libraries when you absolutely have to.
- don't worry about creating the exact styles. i want to website to look as simple as possible. as long as there is a light and dark theme, and the spacing is legible enough, it's acceptable.
- don't use any theme stater templates. let's build from scratch. i want to keep the pages as lightweight as possible. i also prefer minimalist designs for the website. just css variable based theme switching should be enough.

requirements:
- rss feed config needed
- sitemap should be autogenerated
- syntax highlighting is needed (use hugo's built-in chroma)
- external links (content with external: true): redirect user to the external url
