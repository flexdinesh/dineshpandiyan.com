  README!!!! IF YOU USE ANY FONTAWESOME ICON OTHER THAN ONES
  ALREADY USED IN THIS TEMPLATE, IT WON'T WORK. 
  UNCOMMENT THE ORIGINAL FONTAWESOME CSS FILES TO USE OTHER ICONS.
  
  We only use a few fontawesome icons in this template -
  two brand icons (github and twitter) and a few solid icons.
  So we've created a leaner version of the styles that are only needed.
  1. fontawesome.bareminimum.css
  2. brands.bareminimum.css
  3. solid.min.css is already lean so manual stripping was needed

  If you want to use any other icon, you can do one of these two things:
  1. Copy those relevant icons styles from the original 
  fontawesome(or)brands.css stylesheet to 
  fontawesome(or)brands.bareminimum.css stylesheet.
  2. Don't use the leaner *.bareminimum.css stylesheets
  and instead use the full fontawesome(or)brands.min.css stylesheets.

  bareminimum.css is a single stylesheet merged with styles from 
  1. fontawesome.bareminimum.css
  2. brands.bareminimum.css
  3. solid.min.css
